# Machine-Learning-Specialization---Coursera

In this Machine Learning Specialization I learned:
·     Build and train supervised machine learning models for prediction and binary classification tasks using linear regression and logistic regression.
·     Build and train a neural network with TensorFlow to perform multi-class classification.
·     Apply best practices for machine learning development so that your models generalize to data and tasks in the real world.
·     Build and use decision trees and tree ensemble methods, including random forests and boosted trees.
·     Use unsupervised learning techniques : including clustering and anomaly detection.
·     Build recommender systems with a collaborative filtering approach and a content-based deep learning method.
·     Build a deep reinforcement learning model.

By the end of this Specialization, I have mastered key concepts and gained the practical knowledge to apply machine learning to challenging real-world problems.
Machine learning is already present in many areas like: web search, product recommendations, speech recognition, self-driving cars, robotics, manufacturing, agriculture, etc., but we all hope that the best Machine Learning application is still to be invented.
